                <p> I have a deep interest in healthy living and believe that the body can heal itself and maintain a healthy state if given the right conditions. It gives me enormous satisfaction seeing this theory work in practice and knowing that I can contribute to making people’s lives more enjoyable by easing their pain, improving body movement, bettering their sleep, relieving stress and helping them relax. Hearing feedback such as “You made my day” is the biggest achievement and reward! </p>

                <h2> Aromatherapy </h2>
                <br>
                <p> In aromatherapy treatments, essential oils are applied externally, but their penetrative power is so great that they act on the internal organs. The most important method of treatment is by diluting the essential oils in a vegetable “carrier oil” and massaging all body, thus combining the beneficial effects of essential oils with the power of touch. </p>
                <h3> What are the essential oils? </h3>
                <p> Essential oils are highly concentrated volatile substances extracted from plants, flowers, trees, fruit, bark, grasses, and seeds with distinctive therapeutic psychological and physiological properties which improve and prevent illness. Essential oils are usually captured by steam distillation, a process whose origins can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia. </p>
