                <p> I have a deep interest in healthy living and believe that
                the body can heal itself and maintain a healthy state if given
                the right conditions. It gives me enormous satisfaction seeing
                this theory work in practice and knowing that I can contribute
                to making people’s lives more enjoyable by easing their pain,
                improving body movement, bettering their sleep, relieving stress
                and helping them relax. Hearing feedback such as <i>“You made my
                day”</i> is the biggest achievement and reward!</p>

            <div class='card-content'>
                <p> In aromatherapy treatments, essential oils are applied
                externally, but their penetrative power is so great that they
                act on the internal organs. The most important method of
                treatment is by diluting the essential oils in a vegetable
                “carrier oil” and massaging all body, thus combining the
                beneficial effects of essential oils with the power of touch.

                <br>
                <i> What are the essential oils? </i>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Essential oils are highly concentrated volatile substances
                extracted from plants, flowers, trees, fruit, bark, grasses, and
                seeds with distinctive therapeutic psychological and
                physiological properties which improve and prevent illness.
                Essential oils are usually captured by steam distillation, a
                process whose origins can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia.

                then carried out on the chest, shoulders, neck and face using
                essential oils will then bring a deep sense of relaxation as
                tension is eased away. This is followed by a luxurious
                nourishing mask which is left to absorb while the hands or feet
                massaged. </p>

            <div class='card-content'>
                <p> Holistic massage is a well-known treatment that not only
                focusses on tense muscles as a physical result of stress, but it
                also takes into account a client’s emotional and spiritual
                wellbeing. It is an ancient method of healing that stimulates
                the blood circulation and clears the lymphatic drainage system
                which assists in releasing toxins from the body by recognizing
                that illness and stress affects not only one’s physical but also
                emotional, spiritual and mental well-being. Holistic Massage
                allows the body’s natural healing abilities to come forth and
                balance the entire body as a whole. This massage technique has
                been used for thousands of years in Egypt, China and India. The
                term “holistic” derives from the ancient Greek word “holos,”
                which means “whole.” By definition, Holistic Massage treats the
                whole body as a single entity, and is specifically tailored to
                each client. <br> <br> Fundamental to my work as a holistic
                massage therapist is my ability to adapt and respond to the
                unique needs of each client, to customise my treatment
                accordingly and also to take proper care of myself. </p>

            <div class='card-title toggle'> Reflexology </div>
            <div class='card-content'>
                <p> Is the practice of applying pressure to specific points on
                the feet and hands to influence the health of corresponding part
                of the body. “Pressure sensors” ON THE HANDS AND FEET connect
                with different parts of the body, and as reflexology techniques
                stimulate this sensors, waves of relaxation are sent throughout
                the body. </p>
                <p> Modern Reflexology has its origins in the 19 th century and
                became fully developed in the 1930s, when Eunice Ingham and
                others devised charts of reflex zones for the hands and feet.
                However, archaeological evidence suggests that applying pressure
                to hands and feet is an ancient tradition. </p>
                <br>
                <i> Who does reflexology help? </i>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Just about everyone, from tiny babies to the very elderly,
                can benefit from reflexology. The reflexologist doesn’t heal-
                only body heals. But reflexology helps to balance all the body
                systems. </p>
